This is a list of known bugs/glitches.
Should you encounter a glitch that is not listed here, please let me know,
but don't tell me about those already in here. I'm aware of them and just putting them aside
for now because otherwise I would be trying to perfect it forever and I wouldn't advance at all.


Engi HUD glitches
------------------
 - Sometimes the Level indicator on the teleporters doesn't show up when they have been created/destroyed in a specific order
 - Black bar in the disabled version of the Engi HUD items is slightly darker in the dispenser and teleporter items
 - Level indicator "font" differs slightly in the dispenser item


Death notice glitches
----------------------
 - Backburner icon shows "killed in back" on every crit, also on random crits.
