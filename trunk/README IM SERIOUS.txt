
1. Close steam and tf2
2. Double click install.cmd
3. Type your steam user name when asked. This is the name yu use when logging in to Steam
4. Check if there's green text at te bottom of the window, not red text

If there's red text, make sure all TF2 or Steam related applications are closed and retry the install

It is normal for there to be a few "Can't find file" messages in the install log.

THE NEXT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ABOVE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This mod uses a client plugin that hooks into tf2 to do its magic.
----- This means that it can be susceptible to updates, i.e. large updates
      can break it to the point of just crashing on boot or during gameplay.

      If weird things happen after an update, first try reinstalling the mod
      (the installer patches a particular file from the gcfs).

      If that doesn't help you, uninstall the mod with uninstall.cmd (this is fast and painless)
      and wait until I release an update to the mod.
