Go to one of the following urls:

http://www.filefront.com/16435783/release.zip
http://www.mediafire.com/?n3om5zmjdmz

You can download there. FPSBanana doesn't allow the files the mod needs in zip files. 
(files like .cmd files (for installers) and .dll files (to enable the unlock icons/engi hud extensions))
